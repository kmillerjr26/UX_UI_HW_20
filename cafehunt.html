                    <p>My team's research began with one question: <br><br>
                        <span style=" font-style: oblique; font-size: 24px; color: #2680ff;">What is the process coffee drinkers go through to find coffee shops in their area?</span><br><br>
                        More specifically, we wanted to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Figure out what makes a person want to try a new coffee shop</li>
                        <li>Understand the buying decisions and habits of frequent coffee shop customers</li>
                        <li>Identify additional features a coffee lover might want out of a coffee-based app</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>With these objectives in mind, my partner and I compiled a list of 15 interview questions and 13 survey questions.<br><br></p>

                        <div class="col-lg-3">
                            <h4 class="case-study-header2">Interviewees</h4> 
                            <p>5 coffee drinkers ages 20-40 that visit coffee shops</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <h4 class="case-study-header2">Survey Responses</h4> 
                            <p>64 online responses</p>

                    <h4 class="case-study-header">02. Definition</h4>
                    <p>
                        After gathering our research, we began creating an affinity diagram as a team. At first, our app was only going to focus on finding coffee shops, but we found that potential users would want a way to order menu items through the app as well to reduce wait times in-store. They like to 
                        <span style="font-style: oblique; color: #2680ff;"> check reviews beforehand for coffee quality, cleanliness of the shop, and customer service quality through Google, but were frustrated that many reviews could be biased or inaccurate. </span>
                        <br><br>
                        We created a user persona that could accurately reflect the viewpoint of a typical user according to these findings.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="case-study-header2">The Problem</h4> 
                    <p>Young coffee drinkers struggle to find coffee shops that match their personal preferences in terms of style and menu items.</p>
                    <h4 class="case-study-header2">The Solution</h4> 
                    <p>We will create a simple and easy-to-use coffee shop finder app that considers important factors like preferred coffee shop style, menu options, location, and ambience to help young coffee drinkers quickly locate and enjoy a coffee shop that perfectly fits their tastes and preferences.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4 class="case-study-header">03. Ideation</h4>
                    <p>
                        To ideate potential features for CafeHunt, we decided to go through the “I Like, I Wish, What If?” brainstorming process. After this, we determined the importance and feasibility of these possibilities to narrow our scope. In the interest of time (this project had a 2-week deadline), we decided to implement three key features in our prototype:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Search/filter system for finding coffee shops based on user preferences</li>
                            <li>Display information about shops, including location, reviews, and menu</li>
                            <li>Simple online ordering system</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        We created a user flow of the app that details the onboarding process, searching for coffee shops, and placing an order for pickup at a selected shop. Using this as our guide, we began work on the prototype.

                    <h4 class="case-study-header">04. Iteration</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="case-study-header2">Paper Prototypes</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="case-study-header2">User Testing</h4>
                    <p>We tested each of our paper prototypes with 3 people each. After figuring out that the Prototype #1 covered the issues found in the Prototype #2, we decided to go with #1 and solve the issues found in this. From the feedback given by our user testers, we decided to make the following changes going into the low-fidelity prototype:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make buttons/navigation elements more visible using size, color, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>Animated transitions between screens can be less jarring (i.e. slower) in some parts to give users time to read and process screens</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4 class="case-study-header">05. Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                    <br>

                    <h4 class="case-study-header">06. Conclusion and Future Opportunities</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the future, we'd like to complete the user flow for the My Order and My Account sections, as well as include a rewards/points system for ordering to incentivize more customers to order through the app, in addition to creating a UI style with typography and color considered.
